# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to use deep learning neural network models with the help of TensorFlow and Python. With these tools we analyzed the success of charity donations. The following steps were used:
- Preprocess data for our Neural Network Model
- Compile, train and evaluate the Neural Network Model
- Optimize the Neural Network Model
## Resources Used
- Python and its many libraries
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook
## Results of Analysis
###### Data Preprocessing
